Step 1: Download the latest Redis zip file from the official git hub location. For me it is redis-2.4.5-win32-win64.zip.

download from: https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads

Step 2: Extract redis-2.4.5-win32-win64.zip file in your preferred location.\

Step 3: It will come with two different folders, one is for 32bit, and another one is 64bit based on your operating system.

Step 4: Goto 64bit there you can find below files.

Step 5: Double click on the redis-server.exe file, there you can see the redis-server startup and wait for connecting to clients like below.

Step 6: Now open the redis-cli.exe file to redis command line interface.

As this acts as a redis client, as soon as we open this cli, we can see the client connected message in redis server like below.
