1、在npm中安装固定的版本号package，只需要在其后加 ‘@版本号’
	npm install  --save  esri-loader@1.0.0

2、Node Version Manager
	[OSX, *nix] nvm: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
	[Windows] nodist: https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist

3 npm 与 npx的区别

	npx is a npm package runner (x probably stands for eXecute). The typical use is to download and run a package temporarily or for trials.

	create-react-app is an npm package that is expected to be run only once in a project's lifecycle. Hence, it is preferred to use npx to install and run it in a single step.

	As mentioned in the man page https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx, npx can run commands in the PATH or from node_modules/.bin by default.
