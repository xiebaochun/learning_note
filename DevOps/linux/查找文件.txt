# find -iname "filename"

note: Using -iname instead of -name ignores the case of your query. The -name command is case-sensitive.

# find / -iname "filename"

note: Set the search to start in the root directory

# find /home/pat -iname "*.conf"

# find /home/pat -iname "*.conf" | less 

# find / -type f -iname "filename"

# find / -size +50M -iname "filename"
