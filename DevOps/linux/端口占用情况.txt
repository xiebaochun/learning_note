# lsof -i:端口号 用于查看某一端口的占用情况，比如查看8000端口使用情况，
	lsof -i:8000

# mac查看端口占用：
	lsof -i tcp:port

# netstat -tunlp 
	netstat -tunlp | grep 端口号
	netstat -tulnp | grep <port no>
	如查看8000端口的情况，netstat -tunlp | grep 8000

# There's a few parameters to netstat that are useful for this :
	-l or --listening shows only the sockets currently listening for incoming connection.
	-a or --all shows all sockets currently in use.
	-t or --tcp shows the tcp sockets.
	-u or --udp shows the udp sockets.
	-n or --numeric shows the hosts and ports as numbers, instead of resolving in dns and looking in /etc/services.
	You use a mix of these to get what you want. To know which port numbers are currently in use, use one of these:
	netstat -atn           # For tcp
	netstat -aun           # For udp
	netstat -atun          # For both
