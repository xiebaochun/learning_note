2.Decompress .bz2 | .gz file
solution:
	tar xjf filename.tar.bz2
	tar -xvzf filename.tar.gz
	tar xf archive.tar.xz

	f: this must be the last flag of the command, and the tar file must be immediately after. It tells tar the name and path of the compressed file.
	z: tells tar to decompress the archive using gzip
	x: tar can collect files or extract them. x does the latter.
	v: makes tar talk a lot. Verbose output shows you all the files being extracted.
